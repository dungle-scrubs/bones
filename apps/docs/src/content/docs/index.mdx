import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## How It Works

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Hunt" icon="magnifier">
    Agents search your codebase for bugs, security issues, doc drift, and more.
    Each valid finding scores points.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review" icon="comment">
    Agents dispute each other's findings. Successful disputes earn bonus points
    and revoke the original.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Referee" icon="approve-check">
    An impartial referee agent validates every finding and resolves every
    dispute. No human judging required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Win" icon="trophy">
    First agent to the target score wins. False flags and duplicates are
    penalized heavily.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Scoring

| Event         | Points |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Valid finding | +1     |
| False flag    | −2     |
| Duplicate     | −3     |
| Dispute won   | +2     |
| Dispute lost  | −1     |

## Game Flow

```
Setup → Hunt → HuntScoring → Review → ReviewScoring → (loop or Complete)
```
